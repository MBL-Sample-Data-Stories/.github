Home for computational notebooks using sample data (<2GB) collected at MBL in the Advanced Research Training Courses, resident research, and visiting research programs such as Grass Fellows and Whitman.

## What are computational notebooks? Why use them? 
Computational notebooks are an excellent way to tell your story about an interesting dataset. They allow you to combine narrative text, images, code, and scientific figures. Example notebook
technologies include [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html) (MATLAB), and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface).

## How do I create our sample data story? 
Contact [Scott Koerner (skmbl)](https://github.com/skmbl) and provide your GitHub handle to request becoming a member of this GitHub organization. This will give you the privilige to create a private GitHub repository containing your sample data story w/ one or more computational notebook files. 

## How do I publish our sample data? 
Contact [Scott Koerner (skmbl)](https://github.com/skmbl) when you believe your private repository is ready to go public. Some criteria the organization reviewers will use include: 
- Sample data files should total to <2GB
- Sample data should be:
    -  located in a dedicated folder within the repository; and/or
    -  hosted elsewhere, and accessed remotely by the notebook(s)
- Computational notebooks should be _runnable_ on a widely-used execution environment for lightweight notebooks, such as [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) or [MATLAB Online](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-online.html)
