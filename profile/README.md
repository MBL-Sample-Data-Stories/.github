Home for computational notebooks using sample data (<2GB) collected at MBL in the Advanced Research Training Courses, resident research, and visiting research programs such as Grass Fellows and Whitman.

Computational notebooks are an excellent way to tell a story about a data set, combining text, code and scientific figures.  Example notebook
technologies include [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), [live scripts](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/what-is-a-live-script-or-function.html) (MATLAB), and [others](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface).
